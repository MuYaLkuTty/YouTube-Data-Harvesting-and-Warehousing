-------

# Skills Takeaway From This Project:

\_ Python Scripting
\_ Data Collection
\_ MongoDB
\_ Streamlit
\_ API Integration
\_ Data Management using MongoDB (Atlas) and SQL

# Domain: Social Media
### Project Description:

The "YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing" project aims to collect data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API, store it efficiently using MongoDB and SQL databases, and provide a user-friendly interface for data exploration and analysis using Streamlit.

# Key Features:
\_ Data Harvesting:

Utilizes the YouTube Data API to fetch information about videos, channels, comments, likes, and other relevant data.
Supports paginated requests to retrieve large datasets efficiently.
\_ Data Warehousing:

Stores harvested data in both MongoDB and SQL databases for flexibility and scalability.
Implements a structured schema for organizing the data to support efficient querying and analysis.
\_ Streamlit Dashboard:

Develops a Streamlit web application for data exploration and visualization.
Provides interactive widgets and visualizations to analyze YouTube data trends, popular videos, engagement metrics, etc.
\_ API Integration:

Integrates with the YouTube Data API to fetch real-time data and updates.
Handles authentication, request throttling, and error handling for seamless API interactions.
\_ MongoDB Atlas Integration:

Utilizes MongoDB Atlas, a fully managed cloud database service, for data storage and management.
Ensures high availability, scalability, and security of the MongoDB database in the cloud environment.
\_ SQL Database Support:

Offers support for traditional relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL for users who prefer SQL-based querying and analysis.
\_ Project Workflow:
\_ Data Harvesting:

Run Python scripts to fetch data from the YouTube Data API.
Store the raw data in MongoDB collections and SQL tables.
\_ Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the harvested data to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
\_ Data Warehousing:

Insert the preprocessed data into MongoDB collections and SQL tables following the defined schema.
\_ Streamlit Application Development:

Develop interactive dashboards and visualizations using Streamlit to explore and analyze YouTube data.
Incorporate features for filtering, sorting, and aggregating data based on user preferences.

# Use Cases:
Social media marketers can use the application to analyze trends, engagement metrics, and user behavior on YouTube to optimize their content strategy.
Content creators can track the performance of their videos, monitor comments, and understand audience demographics through the Streamlit dashboard.
Researchers and analysts can conduct in-depth studies on topics such as video popularity, audience preferences, and content trends using the collected YouTube data.

# Conclusion:
The "YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing" project provides a comprehensive solution for collecting, storing, and analyzing data from YouTube. By leveraging Python scripting, MongoDB, SQL databases, and Streamlit, users can gain valuable insights into YouTube's vast repository of videos, channels, and user interactions, empowering them to make informed decisions and drive meaningful outcomes in the social media domain.
